Path Planning
=============

This is my Path Planning project done for the Udacity's Self-Driving Car
Nanodegree. Go [here][blog] to read more about it.

Building
--------

The program needs:

 * IPOPT and CppAD ([https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt))
 * uWebSockets ([https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets))
 * The NLohmann's JSON library ([https://github.com/nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json))

If they are installed in system directories, they should be picked up
automatically. Otherwise use `UWEBSOCKETS_ROOTDIR` and `NLOHMANNJSON_ROOT_DIR`.
On MacOS, you may need to set `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` as well.
